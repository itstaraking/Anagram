# FizzBuzz!
FizzBuzz is a game that teaches kids about division. To play, a number is given and if the number is divisible by 3, the number is replaced by the word "Fizz", if divisible by 5, the number is replaced by the word "Buzz" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the number is replaced by the word "FizzBuzz". I took this on as a programming challenge using the numbers 1 through 100 incrementing one number at a time. 

### Here is a snippet of the code
